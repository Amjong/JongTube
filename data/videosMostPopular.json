        "description": "The Sanibel Causeway was rendered completely impassable to vehicles. Less than a month later, it was open to traffic.\nCheck out the Practical Engineering store: https://store.practical.engineering/\n\nWatch on Nebula: https://nebula.tv/videos/practical-engineering-how-this-bridge-was-rebuilt-in-15-days-after-hurricane-ian\n\nErrata: (None yet)\n\nBoth Florida DOT and Superior Construction were contacted for comment on this story. FDOT declined to comment, and Superior Construction did not respond to multiple emails.\n\nBarrier islands are critical to protecting mainland coasts by absorbing wave energy and bearing the brunt of storms. But development on the islands negates that critical purpose. That doesn’t mean the community doesn’t belong there. But it does obligate the planners and engineers involved in rebuilding to be thoughtful about the impacts hurricanes can have and how infrastructure can be made more resilient to them in the future.\n\nPractical Engineering is a YouTube channel about infrastructure and the human-made world around us.

          "description": "The Sanibel Causeway was rendered completely impassable to vehicles. Less than a month later, it was open to traffic.\nCheck out the Practical Engineering store: https://store.practical.engineering/\n\nWatch on Nebula: https://nebula.tv/videos/practical-engineering-how-this-bridge-was-rebuilt-in-15-days-after-hurricane-ian\n\nErrata: (None yet)\n\nBoth Florida DOT and Superior Construction were contacted for comment on this story. FDOT declined to comment, and Superior Construction did not respond to multiple emails.\n\nBarrier islands are critical to protecting mainland coasts by absorbing wave energy and bearing the brunt of storms. But development on the islands negates that critical purpose. That doesn’t mean the community doesn’t belong there. But it does obligate the planners and engineers involved in rebuilding to be thoughtful about the impacts hurricanes can have and how infrastructure can be made more resilient to them in the future.\n\nPractical Engineering is a YouTube channel about infrastructure and the human-made world around us.
